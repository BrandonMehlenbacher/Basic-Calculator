# Basic-Calculator
This is a simple calculator that was built using Tkinter.
All that is needed is to run the python file that is provided.
This is the first version, hopefully in the coming weeks I am able to work out some of the existing bugs in the code as well as add
some more features that would make it into more of a scientific calculator
